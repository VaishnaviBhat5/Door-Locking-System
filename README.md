üîß 1. Hardware Overview
The system includes the following major hardware components:

Microcontroller (e.g., AVR ATmega32 / ARM LPC2148): Serves as the brain of the system, managing inputs, outputs, and logic execution.

4x4 Keypad: Used for entering numeric passwords.

16x2 LCD Display: Displays instructions, feedback, and password entry status.

Electromagnetic Lock or Relay & Motor: Simulates the door locking/unlocking mechanism.

Buzzer: Alerts on wrong password entry or unauthorized access attempts.

Power Supply & Breadboard Circuit: Supports and connects all components.

The schematic image attached to the project shows the physical wiring and pin configuration, including power rails, port connections, and grounding, which reflects a clean, well-structured embedded system layout.

üíª 2. Software & Code Functionality
The system firmware is written in Embedded C, programmed onto the microcontroller using platforms like AVR Studio, Keil, or Arduino IDE. Key functions include:

Password Entry via Keypad: User inputs a 4-digit password using the keypad.

Real-Time LCD Feedback: As digits are entered, the display shows masked characters (e.g., ‚Äò*‚Äô) and feedback messages like ‚ÄúEnter Password‚Äù or ‚ÄúAccess Granted.‚Äù

Password Verification:

If the password is correct, the system activates a relay to simulate unlocking the door and displays ‚ÄúAccess Granted.‚Äù

If the password is incorrect, it increases a counter and shows ‚ÄúWrong Password.‚Äù

Security Lockout:

After 3 failed attempts, the system locks further inputs and activates the buzzer for a warning.

Optional Features (customizable):

Password change mechanism.

EEPROM-based memory to store passwords permanently.

GSM module integration for remote alerts.

‚öôÔ∏è 3. Working Principle
The microcontroller constantly monitors the keypad. On receiving input, it compares the password with a pre-stored value. If correct, it sends a signal to the locking mechanism (via GPIO pins). This provides a real-time decision-making process combining both digital logic and physical control.

üì∑ 4. Image Analysis
The circuit image included in the project shows:

Neatly routed connections between the microcontroller, keypad, LCD, and locking module.

Power and ground lines clearly defined for each component.

Use of resistors, jumper wires, and possible voltage regulators for safe operation.

This visual representation helps in understanding the practical implementation and component layout, which is essential for debugging and scaling.

üìå 6. Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the development of a functional and reliable door security system using microcontroller programming and hardware interfacing. It not only focuses on password-based access control but also integrates real-time alert mechanisms and feedback systems. The project serves as a strong example of applied embedded systems in the field of IoT and electronic security.
